# Back-to Object Oriented Programming Style (1980s-Present) <a name="boop"></a>
  - ### BIG IDEA #1 ‚Äî The state of the program is immutable and is only changed by creating a totally new state by modifying the old state.
  - ### BIG IDEA #2 - The state of the objects is private and only mutable via methods that are called on the object.  

## Alan Kay Style BOOP (The _Original_ Object Oriented Programming)
  - Based on the idea of "messaging" between objects, VERY poorly named "object oriented programming", admitted 
    by Alan Kay himself, the inventor of the term.

    >> ### Alan Kay:
    >> - **"I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term ‚Äúobjects‚Äù for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea."** 
    >> - The big idea is ‚Äúmessaging.‚Äù 
    >> - The key in making great and growable systems is much more to have things communicate through _messages_ and not through direct mutable state.
    
  - ### BOOP style takes the message metaphor to mean that the state of the program is immutable except by sending a message to create a new state.
    - The `object` state can only changed by creating a new state via modifying the old state by calling `public` 
      method on objects.
    - All state of the `object` is `private` and only accessible via methods that are called on the object.

  - All state is fully retained in the `object` and methods are used to "send messages" to the `object` to
    change its state. This "messaging" metaphor stands up because internal state is not directly accessible. You
    must politely ask the object to change its state, and the object can choose to respond to the message or not.
    Unlike in COP where internal state is routinely exposed and directly manipulated via `static` methods and variables.
  - Any state of the object is exposed only via "messages", or method calls on the object, and the object can choose to respond to
    the message or not.
  - No `static` methods or variables, only instance variables that are private to the `object`.
    - Use of `static` methods and variables is specifically disallowed as it leads to "shared mutable state" and
      "side effects" that are difficult to maintain and understand.
      > Objects vs. Static Methods
      >   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0dqC_3Bch8
  - `protected` methods are allowed, but discouraged as they lead to "fragile" and "rigid" code.
  - Use of inheritance is explicitly discouraged, and prefer composition over inheritance. Exceptions for shallow
    hierarchies of 2-3 levels maximum meant to model the real world objects, not to create a "hierarchy of types."
  - Use of interfaces is limited to Classes that require testing, and are not automatically added for every class.
  - Use of `setters` and `getters` is specifically disallowed. Instead, the object is expected to respond to messages to change its
    state, and to respond to messages to get its state.
   
  - There are only a few true BOOP languages, "Smalltalk," "Ruby," and, _incredibly_, "Javascript" are among the most popular ones.

 - ### Specific COP-like "Design Patterns" are *NOT* permitted, such as:
   - Factory Pattern
   - Abstract Factory Pattern
   - Adapter Pattern is strongly discouraged, and prefer composition over inheritance.
   - Facade, Bridge, Proxy and Decorator Patterns are all very similar to the Adapter Pattern and are discouraged.
   - Builder Pattern considered too clumsy, the "Fluent" pattern is preferred 
     - "Fluent Pattern" is where an `object` is modified and returned to the caller to allow for "method chaining."
   - Type-casting is frowned upon, and prefer the use of interfaces or composition as type-casting was only necessary 
     for COP style implementations.

     >   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrTBIcFhawI
 
 - ### Other disallowed patterns common in COP:
   - Use of `null`
   - Use of `static` methods and variables
   - `Get`-ters and `Set`-ters
   - Reflection & Type Casting
   - Inheritance more than 2-3 levels deep. Prefer no inheritance and use composition instead.
   - Mutable State - All state in BOOP is immutable, and the object is expected to return a new object with the new state.
   - Classes ending with -er that mutate data passed in without retaining state internal to the object.
     - Like `Manager`, `Controller`, `Handler`, `Processor`, `Updater`, `Setter`, `Getter`, `Modifier`, `Changer`, etc.
 - Amazingly, the dreaded Singleton Pattern _is allowed_ to manage global state in BOOP, but not `static` variables or methods.
  
## Why is Class-Oriented Programming (COP) Bad? <a name="why-is-cop-bad"></a>
  - ###### why-is-cop-bad
  - The main problem with COP is that it's common practices lead to fragile code that was difficult to maintain and
    understand, for similar reasons as to why "Spaghetti Code" is difficult to maintain and understand.
