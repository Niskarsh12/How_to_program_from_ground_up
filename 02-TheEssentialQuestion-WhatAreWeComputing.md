# THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION IN COMPUTING - What are we Representing?
- Everything in computing is REPRESENTING digital information "as" something _else_.
- Kinds of representations through history:

    - ## Punched Holes in a paper card - 1800s to 1970s
        - Vast improvement over the paper ledger
        - Collection of data was standardized, fast and could be read by a machine
        - Data collected from the 1890 US Census was the first large scale use of punched cards
        - Allowed for the first "programmable" machines that could be used to perform relatively complex tasks
          like sorting and counting of specific data

    - ## Magnetic Phenomenon - 1950s to present
        - Electronically detectable areas on magnetizable material, or the presence of a magnetic field in a specific area

        - Core Memory - 1955 to 1975

        - Magnetic Tape - 1928 to present
          - "Sequential" access to data, like a cassette tape or a VHS tape.

        - Magnetic Disk - 1956 to present
            - "Random" access to data, like a record player or a CD player, and uses mechanical means to access the data

    - ## Tiny electrical charge of a capacitor (gaps between metals) in a tiny area of space - 1960s to present
        - DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) Chip (10x magnification), not mechanical at all, just electrical.

- ## Creating ANY machine capable of using "Boolean Logic" enables humans to create complex, custom general solutions to certain kinds of problems.
    - The problems must be able to be represented with binary information and the solution must be able to be
      represented with a series of logical operations.
    - By building up from the simple logic of `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operations, humans can create an
      arbitrarily complex sequence of logical operations.
    - These logical operations are sequenced in time to create "State Machines" that can perform complex tasks
      and solve complex problems. A state machine is simply a way of representing the problem that changes over time
      controlled by a series of logical operations & conditions that lead to certain states and available actions.
    - These logical operations are built up using patterns called "algorithms" grouped together in "programs" that
      can be executed by a digital computer.

      > ## All of this "technology" is based on human ingenuity and cleverness to exploit certain properties of naturally occurring phenomenon in a way to create some "useful human work".
      > ### The machines cannot possibly "know" anything about the problem or solution, and never will.

      ### It's just following the logical operations that humans have carefully designed to represent the problem and represent a solution.
