# Software Design

## Algorithms - How are we gonna solve this?
  - Algorithms are just a set of instructions that are used to solve a problem or perform a task, all based on the
    cleverness and creativity of the designer. People have invented many ways to solve problems, and some of these
    are so common that they have been given names, like "sorting" and "searching" algorithms.

## Time Complexity - How long is this gonna take?
  - ### BiG IDEA - Let's have a standard way to communicate about how long an algorithm will take to run
  - The "time complexity" of a program is a measure of how the "running time" of the program grows as the "input size"
    of the program grows.
  - Also known as "Algorithmic Complexity" or "Big O notation"
  - The "time complexity" is usually expressed as a "big O" notation, which is a way to express the "upper bound" of
    the "running time" of the program.
  - The "big O" notation is a way to express the "upper bound" or maximum expected of the worst-case running time of a program.
  - 6 Common Types of Time Complexity:
      - O(1) - "Constant Time" - The running time of the program does not change as the input size of the program grows.
      - O(n) - "Linear Time" - The running time of the program grows as the input size of the program.
      - O(n^2) - "Quadratic Time" - The running time of the program grows as the square of the input size of the program.
      - O(n^3) - "Cubic Time" - The running time of the program grows as the cube of the input size of the program.
      - O(log n) - "Logarithmic Time" - The running time of the program grows as the logarithm of the input size of the program.
      - O(n log n) - "Linearithmic Time" - The running time of the program grows as the product of the input size of the program and the logarithm of the input size of the program.

  - ### Shorthand:
    - If you are doing a simple lookup in an array, it's O(1) because the time it takes to find the value in the array
      does not change as the size of the array grows.
    - If you are looping over items, it's O(n) because the time it takes to loop over the items grows as the size of the
      array grows.
    - If you are looping over items that are also looping over items, it's O(n^2) because the time it takes to loop over
      the items grows as the square of the size of the array grows.
    - Each time you add another loop, the time complexity grows as the square of the size of the array grows.
    - If you are doing a binary search, and each time you search you are cutting the size of the array in half,
      it's O(log n) 
 
    - ```Kotlin
      fun randomInt(max: Int) = (0..max).random()
      
      fun Array<Int>.binarySearch(value: Int): Int {
          // Perform binary search a sorted array - O(log n)
          // Returns the index of the value in the array, or -1 if the value is not found.
          var low = 0
          var high = size - 1
          while (low <= high) {
              val mid = (low + high) / 2
              val midVal = this[mid]
              when {
                  midVal < value -> low = mid + 1
                  midVal > value -> high = mid - 1
                  else -> return mid
              }
          }
          
          return -1 // -1 = value not found
      }
      
      fun Array<Int>.quickSort(): Array<Int> {
          // Perform recursive quicksort - O(n log n)
          // Returns a new sorted array.
          if (size < 2) return this
          val pivot = this[randomInt(size - 1)]
          
          val less = filter { it < pivot }.toTypedArray().quickSort()
          val equal = filter { it == pivot }.toTypedArray()
          val greater = filter { it > pivot }.toTypedArray().quickSort()
          
          return less + equal + greater
      }
      
      fun main() {
         val x = Array(100) { randomInt(100) } // <-- O(n) - Fill Array x with 100 random integers
         
         val a = x[50] // <-- O(1)
         for (i in 0 until x.size) { // <-- O(n)
             println(x[i])
         }
         
         for (i in 0 until x.size) { // <-- O(n)
             for (j in 0 until x.size) { // <-- O(n^2)
                 println(x[i] + x[j])
             }
         }
         
         for (i in 0 until x.size) { // <-- O(n)
             for (j in 0 until x.size) { // <-- O(n^2)
                 for (k in 0 until x.size) { // <-- O(n^3)
                     println(x[i] + x[j] + x[k])
                 }
             }
         }
         
         val sorted = x.quickSort() // <-- O(n log n)
         val y = sorted.binarySearch(50) // <-- O(log n)
      }
      
      // << NO OUTPUT - Just sample code illustrating the time complexity of the operations - check sample code for output >>

## Communicating Software Designs - How do we talk about these things with other people? 
  - ### The Line, The Box and The Layers
    - At the time when structured programming took off, the concept of "Software Design" was introduced
      as people created more complex software systems with more complex requirements and larger teams of people working
      together to create the software.
