# Conclusion
- The different paradigms are not better or worse than each other, they are just different styles to structure the
  state and behavior of software to provide a solution.
- Different paradigms can be combined together to create a program that is easier to understand and maintain.
- Paradigms are not frozen and are constantly evolving as new ideas are added to the software development
  methods to make creating software easier and more effective.
- Each paradigm has their own trade-offs and costs that must be considered when
  choosing which paradigm is appropriate for a particular problem. Sometimes, the best solution is the simplest one.
- Paradigms are not dogma, and should not be followed blindly, but should be used as a guide to help
  structure and organization the program to be easiest to understand and change.
- Paradigms are not independent, and are often used together to create a program that is easier to
  understand and maintain.
