# Conclusion

## Paradigms are Just Different Styles to Structure and Organize Software
  - The different paradigms are not better or worse than each other, they are just different styles to structure the
    state and behavior of software to provide a solution.
  - Different paradigms can be combined together to create a program that is easier to understand and maintain.
  - Paradigms are not frozen and are constantly evolving as new ideas are added to the software development
    methods to make creating software easier and more effective.
  - Each paradigm has their own trade-offs and costs that must be considered when
    choosing which paradigm is appropriate for a particular problem. Sometimes, the best solution is the simplest one.
  - Paradigms are not dogma, and should not be followed blindly, but should be used as a guide to help
    structure and organization the program to be easiest to understand and change.
  - Paradigms are not independent, and are often used together to create a program that is easier to
    understand and maintain.
 
## Programming Will Always Be a Human Activity - AI Cannot Solve Everything and Requires Human Guidance
  - Solution methods will become a bit more abstract in the future using tools like GitHub copilot, but the
    programmer will still need to know all these details to get the machine to do EXACTLY what they want it to do.
  - We are always going to need people who have various tastes and understandings about humans and the world to
    create software that is useful and effective FOR HUMANS.
